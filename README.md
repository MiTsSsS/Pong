# Purpose
I made Pong to learn SFML.

# How to use
This project requires C++20 and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
  
- [How to setup SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php)
  
You can clone this repo, run the project, and play some Pong! It should run with no issues if you have SFML setup correctly.  
It might also benefit you if you want to learn SFML so feel free to modify the code!

# Lessons Learned
- Handling the `sf::RenderWindow` while it's open.
- Loading and using `sf::Fonts`.
- Displaying `sf::Text` on screen.
- Loading and playing sound files using `sf::SoundBuffer` and `sf::Sound`.
- Simple collision detection using `sf::FloatRect`.
- Limiting FPS using `setFramerateLimit`.
